# HELP App
A prototype app to call for help from an Android Wear using gestures. Created as a through-away prototype for my mobile health class.

Makes use of the <a href="http://presto.watch">http://presto.watch</a> libary to detect gestures.

Also has a companion app to display when the gestures are detected etc. and actually make a call or send a text message. In a real world deployment, the companion app could run without any UI.
